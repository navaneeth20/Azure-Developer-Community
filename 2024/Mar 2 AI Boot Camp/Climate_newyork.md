According to the [[Köppen climate classification]], the '''climate of [[New York City]]''' is [[humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] ('''Cfa'''), with parts of the city transitioning into a [[humid continental climate]]. ('''Dfa''').<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Koppen_World_Map_%28retouched_version%29.png|title=World Map of Köppen-Geiger climate classification|last1=Peel|first1=M.C.|last2=Finlayson|first2=B.L.|publisher=The University of Melbourne |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113015116/http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Koppen_World_Map_%28retouched_version%29.png|archive-date=January 13, 2015|url-status=dead|access-date=27 June 2020}}</ref> The city experiences moderately cold, somewhat wet and snowy winters; and hot, humid summers with plentiful rainfall all year round. Also, New York's enormous population, human activity, and vast amounts of large buildings and streets, which absorb sunlight during the day, contribute significantly to the [[urban heat island effect]]. Were it not for this phenomenon, its climate would probably be within the humid continental temperature range. 

Meteorological records have been kept at [[Central Park]] since 1821, although the station was relocated to a different part of the park on January 1, 1920.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/GHCND/stations/GHCND:USW00094728/detail|title=Station Data Inventory, Access & History|publisher=NOAA|access-date=27 June 2020}}</ref> There are also other weather stations in the area including one at [[LaGuardia Airport]], beginning in 1940, and at [[JFK Airport]], beginning in 1948. However, due to Central Park's long records and central location, it is often considered the main station for the city. Hence, all records unless otherwise stated will be for this station.

The highest temperature ever observed in Central Park is {{Convert|106|F|C}} on July 9, 1936 - although LaGuardia reported {{Convert|107|F|C}} on July 3, 1966, and the lowest is {{Convert|-15|F|C}} on February 9, 1934. The lowest daily maximum is {{Convert|2|F|C}} on December 30, 1917. The highest daily minimum at Central Park is {{Convert|87|F|C}} on July 2, 1903.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.weather.gov/media/okx/Climate/CentralPark/warmcolddays.pdf|title=Warmest and Coldest Days at Central Park (1869 to Present)|publisher=NOAA|access-date=27 June 2020}}</ref> 

The city can be prone to extremes. Snowfall averages {{convert|29.8|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} per year but is highly variable between winter seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.erh.noaa.gov/okx/climate/records/wetdryyearsmonths.html|title = Record Wet and Dry Years and Months at CPK|publisher = NWS Upton, New York|access-date = 2020-07-05}}</ref> The city can also be prone to strong winds, being a coastal location it is exposed to the Atlantic. This can be especially pronounced during the autumn and winter months, with a gust of {{Convert|78|mph}} being reported on December 2, 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.weather.gov/media/okx/Climate/CentralPark/extremes.pdf|title=All-Time Extremes Central Park, NY (1869 to Present)|publisher=NOAA|access-date=14 June 2021}}</ref> [[Governors Island]], [[Manhattan]], in [[New York Harbor]], is planned to host a US$1 billion research and education center poised to make New York City the global leader in addressing the [[climate change|climate crisis]].<ref name=NYCGlobalClimateLeader>{{cite web|url=https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/781-22/mayor-adams-trust-governors-island-finalist-proposals-climate-solutions-center#/0|title= Mayor Adams, Trust For Governors Island Unveil Finalist Proposals For Climate Solutions Center|publisher=City of New York|date=October 26, 2022|access-date=October 29, 2022}}</ref>

== Classifications ==
[[File:Union Square.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]] in autumn]]
New York City falls under different climate types depending on the climate classification system used. However, the [[Köppen climate classification]] system is the most widely used climate classification scheme, in which New York City falls under the [[Humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] zone.

Most of the city is found in 7b, with forested areas and parks being in 7a, as shown in Staten Island and suburban areas. The city also has some small densely populated areas in 8a, like around Laguardia airport.<ref>{{Cite web |title=USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map 1 |url=https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/ |access-date=2023-04-12 |website=planthardiness.ars.usda.gov |language=en-us}}</ref>

==Temperature==
The city's regime of temperature features large seasonal swings, with four distinct seasons. However, due to its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, these swings are less significant than areas further inland. The Atlantic serves as a moderator of the temperature meaning the city is milder than areas inland during the winter and cooler during the summer. Although, being on the east coast, this effect is less pronounced. All extremes are for the Central Park station.

===Averages===
In an average year, the temperature will usually be between {{Convert|8|F}} and {{Convert|97|F}} with temperatures greatly exceeding these values being uncommon. Temperatures above {{Convert|100|F}} and below {{Convert|0|F}} are very rare, with the last occurrences being July 18, 2012 and February 14, 2016, respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather2000.com/NY_Cold.html |title=Days below 0°F in New York City |access-date=24 June 2021 |archive-date=26 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220326153735/http://weather2000.com/NY_Cold.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Other phenomena==
===Sunshine, UV and daylight===
The city generally experiences sunny conditions. As a result of New York City's latitude, {{coord|40.712740|N|74.005974|W|region:US-NY|format=dms|display=inline,title}}, it is not subject to the extremes of daylight that places much farther north see.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gps-coordinates.net/|title=GPS coordinates, latitude and longitude with interactive Maps|website=www.gps-coordinates.net}}</ref> However, it is far north enough for there to be a moderate change of possible daylight hours throughout the year.<ref name="Weather Atlas NYC2">{{cite web |url=https://www.weather-us.com/en/new-york-usa/new-york-climate |title=New York, New York, USA - Monthly weather forecast and Climate data |publisher=Weather Atlas |access-date=4 July 2019}}</ref>

===Wind===
The wind is seldom strong in New York City but can occasionally be noticeable. This is especially true in the autumn and winter seasons when [[extratropical]] depressions often bring strong winds. The strongest gust in Central Park, of {{Convert|78|mph}}, occurred on December 2, 1974, however, a station at The Battery reported a gust of {{Convert|113|mph}} on October 14, 1954.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.weather.gov/media/okx/Climate/CentralPark/extremes.pdf |title = All-Time Extremes Central Park, NY (1869 to Present) |publisher = [[National Weather Service]]|access-date = 25 June 2021}}</ref>
However, tropical storms can sometimes affect the area, although they are infrequent and usually weak. Most recently [[Hurricane Sandy]] struck the city on October 29, 2012, causing billions of dollars in damage. It resulted in loss of power, severe flooding and many residents being displaced.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www1.nyc.gov/site/cdbgdr/about/About%20Hurricane%20Sandy.page#:~:text=Impact%20of%20Hurricane%20Sandy&text=The%20storm%20resulted%20in%20the,New%20Yorkers%20were%20temporarily%20displaced. |title = Impact of Hurricane Sandy |publisher = 1.nyc.gov |access-date = 25 June 2021 |archive-date = 25 June 2021 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210625065159/https://www1.nyc.gov/site/cdbgdr/about/About%20Hurricane%20Sandy.page#:~:text=Impact%20of%20Hurricane%20Sandy&text=The%20storm%20resulted%20in%20the,New%20Yorkers%20were%20temporarily%20displaced. |url-status = dead }}</ref>

==Climate change==
{{main|Climate change in New York City}}
[[File:DSC 4585 (8204033522).jpg|alt=The Queens–Midtown Tunnel is seen flooded in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.|thumb|[[Queens–Midtown Tunnel]] after flooding caused by [[Hurricane Sandy]] on October 29, 2012. Climate change means events like this will become more likely.]]
Being a coastal city, New York City is expected to experience significant effects from rising sea levels. Predictions that the sea level will rise by as much as {{Convert|6|ft}} by 2100 have prompted the city's mayor to invest $10 billion into keeping the city safe.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265833/new-york-city-climate-change-sea-level-rise-bill-de-blasio-development|title =NYC mayor has a $10 billion plan to protect Manhattan from rising seas |date =14 March 2019 |publisher = [[The Verge]]|access-date = 25 June 2021}}</ref> The city is also expected to become more susceptible to storm surges and flooding, meaning events like Hurricane Sandy's impacts will become more likely in the future.

===Temperature===
The temperature in New York City has generally increased steadily of the last 150 years and this trend is expected to continue due to anthropogenic warming. By 2080, it is predicted that the climate of the city will be similar to northern [[Arkansas]]. The mean temperature has risen by {{convert|2.4|F-change}} since the 1970s and this warming is expected to accelerate in the coming decades.<ref>{{cite web |url =https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/02/12/global-warming-climate-change-shift-climates-south/2847860002/|title =By 2080, global warming will make New York City feel like Arkansas|newspaper = [[USA Today]]|access-date = 25 June 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url =https://www.dec.ny.gov/energy/94702.html#:~:text=The%20annual%20average%20temperature%20statewide,northern%20parts%20of%20New%20York.|title =Impacts of Climate Change in New York|newspaper = [[USA Today]]|access-date = 25 June 2021}}</ref>

===Precipitation===
Precipitation in the city has significantly increased since 2000; both rainfall and snowfall have risen, but snowfall has increased much more significantly. However, it is argued that such trends, being so recent, make it impossible to predict whether such increases will continue or become steadier.<ref>{{cite web |url =https://newyorkyimby.com/2017/12/why-new-york-citys-rapidly-rising-snowfall-totals-are-no-holiday-miracle.html|title =Why New York City's Rapidly Rising Snowfall Totals Are No Holiday Miracle|date =29 December 2017|publisher = New York Yimby|access-date = 25 June 2021}}</ref>
