# Redeem your Copilot Coupon

To work with Copilot you need a subscription. Because we do want to interfere with existing subscriptions from companies, we created vouchers for this that you can redeem.

Please follow the next steps carefully to redeem your Copilot trial subscription. The coupon gives access to Copilot for 7 days.

## :shoe: Step 1
Log in to GitHub with the GitHub user you want to use during the Global DevOps Experience.

>Verify you are logged-in otherwise the next steps will fail and the voucher get's voided!

## :triangular_flag_on_post: Step 2
- Browse  to https://github.com/redeem/cfp-gdex24-x (replace X with the code for your region).

Click on the "Get access to GitHub Copilot" button

## :rocket: Step 5
Configure Copilot so it will not feed your data into the model for training purposes. This is done by **de-selecting** the option `Allow GitHub to use my code snippets for product improvements` 

![Select Preferences](./images/2024-06-10-23-31-44.png)

One other setting that is important is that you Allow or Disallow the use of public matching code. Disallow this if you are worried about GPL licenced code that migth get sugegsted to you, that could potentialy get you into the obligtion to also publish your own code.

:point_up_2: Click "Save and get started"

## Step 6 :tada: You are done and ready to use Copilot!
